                        Mesopotamia (Ancient Greek: Μεσοποταμία Mesopotamíā; Arabic: بِلَاد ٱلرَّافِدَيْن Bilād
                        ar-Rāfidayn;
                        Classical Syriac: ܐܪܡ ܢܗܪ̈ܝܢ, Ārām-Nahrīn or ܒܝܬ ܢܗܪ̈ܝܢ, Bēṯ Nahrīn) is a historical region of
                        Western
                        Asia situated within the Tigris–Euphrates river system, in the northern part of the Fertile
                        Crescent.
                        Mesopotamia occupies most of present-day Iraq and Kuwait. The historical region includes the
                        head of
                        the
                        Persian Gulf and parts of present-day Iran, Syria, and Turkey.

                        The Sumerians and Akkadians (including Assyrians and Babylonians) dominated Mesopotamia from the
                        beginning of written history (c. 3100 BC) to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC, when it was
                        conquered by
                        the
                        Achaemenid Empire. It fell to Alexander the Great in 332 BC, and after his death, it became part
                        of
                        the
                        Greek Seleucid Empire. Later the Arameans dominated major parts of Mesopotamia (c. 900 BC – 270
                        AD).

                        Around 150 BC, Mesopotamia was under the control of the Parthian Empire. Mesopotamia became a
                        battleground between the Romans and Parthians, with western parts of Mesopotamia coming under
                        ephemeral
                        Roman control. In 226 AD, the eastern regions of Mesopotamia fell to the Sassanid Persians. The
                        division
                        of Mesopotamia between Roman (Byzantine from 395 AD) and Sassanid Empires lasted until the 7th
                        century
                        Muslim conquest of Persia of the Sasanian Empire and Muslim conquest of the Levant from
                        Byzantines.
                        A
                        number of primarily neo-Assyrian and Christian native Mesopotamian states existed between the
                        1st
                        century BC and 3rd century BC, including Adiabene, Osroene, and Hatra.

                        Mesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around

                        BC.
                        It has been identified as having "inspired some of the most important developments in human
                        history,
                        including the invention of the wheel, the planting of the first cereal crops, and the

                            The regional toponym Mesopotamia (/ˌmɛsəpəˈteɪmiə/, Ancient Greek: Μεσοποταμία '[land]
                            between
                            rivers'; Arabic: بِلَاد ٱلرَّافِدَيْن Bilād ar-Rāfidayn or بَيْن ٱلنَّهْرَيْن Bayn
                            an-Nahrayn;
                            Persian: میان‌رودان miyân rudân; Syriac: ܒܝܬ ܢܗܪ̈ܝܢ Beth Nahrain "land of rivers") comes
                            from the
                            ancient Greek root words μέσος (mesos, 'middle') and ποταμός (potamos, 'river') and
                            translates to
                            '(land) between rivers'. It is used throughout the Greek Septuagint (c. 250 BC) to translate
                            the
                            Hebrew and Aramaic equivalent Naharaim. An even earlier Greek usage of the name Mesopotamia
                            is
                            evident from The Anabasis of Alexander, which was written in the late 2nd century AD but
                            specifically refers to sources from the time of Alexander the Great. In the Anabasis,
                            Mesopotamia
                            was used to designate the land east of the Euphrates in north Syria. The term Ārām Nahrīn
                            (Classical
                            Syriac: ܐܪܡ ܢܗܪ̈ܝܢ) (Hebrew: ארם נהריים, Aram Naharayim) was used multiple times in the Old
                            Testament of the Bible to describe "Aram between the (two) rivers".

                        <div class="paragraph">
                            The Aramaic term biritum/birit narim corresponded to a similar geographical concept. Later,
                            the
                            term Mesopotamia was more generally applied to all the lands between the Euphrates and the
                            Tigris,
                            thereby incorporating not only parts of Syria but also almost all of Iraq and southeastern
                            Turkey. The neighbouring steppes to the west of the Euphrates and the western part of the
                            Zagros
                            Mountains are also often included under the wider term Mesopotamia.

                            A further distinction is usually made between Northern or Upper Mesopotamia and Southern or
                            Lower
                            Mesopotamia. Upper Mesopotamia, also known as the Jazira, is the area between the Euphrates
                            and
                            the Tigris from their sources down to Baghdad.[18] Lower Mesopotamia is the area from
                            Baghdad to the
                            Persian Gulf and includes Kuwait and parts of western Iran.

                            In modern academic usage, the term Mesopotamia often also has a chronological connotation.
                            It is
                            usually used to designate the area until the Muslim conquests, with names like Syria,
                            Jazira, and
                            Iraq being used to describe the region after that date. It has been argued that these later
                            euphemisms[clarification needed] are Eurocentric terms attributed to the region in the midst
                            of
                            various 19th-century Western encroachments.
