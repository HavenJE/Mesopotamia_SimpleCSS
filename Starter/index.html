                    Mesopotamia (Ancient Greek: Μεσοποταμία Mesopotamíā; Arabic: بِلَاد ٱلرَّافِدَيْن Bilād ar-Rāfidayn;
                    Classical Syriac: ܐܪܡ ܢܗܪ̈ܝܢ, Ārām-Nahrīn or ܒܝܬ ܢܗܪ̈ܝܢ, Bēṯ Nahrīn) is a historical region of
                    Western
                    Asia situated within the Tigris–Euphrates river system, in the northern part of the Fertile
                    Crescent.
                    Mesopotamia occupies most of present-day Iraq and Kuwait. The historical region includes the head of
                    the
                    Persian Gulf and parts of present-day Iran, Syria, and Turkey.

                    The Sumerians and Akkadians (including Assyrians and Babylonians) dominated Mesopotamia from the
                    beginning of written history (c. 3100 BC) to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC, when it was conquered by
                    the
                    Achaemenid Empire. It fell to Alexander the Great in 332 BC, and after his death, it became part of
                    the
                    Greek Seleucid Empire. Later the Arameans dominated major parts of Mesopotamia (c. 900 BC – 270 AD).

                    Around 150 BC, Mesopotamia was under the control of the Parthian Empire. Mesopotamia became a
                    battleground between the Romans and Parthians, with western parts of Mesopotamia coming under
                    ephemeral
                    Roman control. In 226 AD, the eastern regions of Mesopotamia fell to the Sassanid Persians. The
                    division
                    of Mesopotamia between Roman (Byzantine from 395 AD) and Sassanid Empires lasted until the 7th
                    century
                    Muslim conquest of Persia of the Sasanian Empire and Muslim conquest of the Levant from Byzantines.
                    A
                    number of primarily neo-Assyrian and Christian native Mesopotamian states existed between the 1st
                    century BC and 3rd century BC, including Adiabene, Osroene, and Hatra.

                    Mesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000
                    BC.
                    It has been identified as having "inspired some of the most important developments in human history,
                    including the invention of the wheel, the planting of the first cereal crops, and the development of
                    cursive script, mathematics, astronomy, and agriculture". It has been known as one of the earliest
                    civilizations to ever exist in the world.
